## AI-Powered Book Summary Twitter Bot with AWS and OpenAI (2023)
The AI-Powered Book Summary Twitter Bot uses AWS Lambda, S3, Systems Manager Parameter Store, and CloudWatch, with OpenAI's API to generate book summaries. The Lambda function fetches a random book title from S3 and generates a summary using OpenAI's API, then crafts a Tweet and posts it on Twitter. This project automates information dissemination and promotes literature globally.
